This is the place to record memorable things in my life. Life is a journey with trip and falls, so I consider it random. There are a lot of things I am grateful to, and I would like to say that life is wonderful. How I wish I could use the word randful (rand(om) + (wonder)ful) to describe this blog! But previously I had another [blog](https://advranderfullife.netlify.app) with the name `adventures in randerful life`, which I failed to maintain because I updated my system and hugo version. (This is one of the reasons that kept me from updating contents in my blog.) So I migrated previous content here and picked up blogging.

The blogs will mainly be written by me and my wife. They can be about any aspect of life: about work, about friends, about family, or even about food. I intend to write in English and Chinese with no clear rules. But since I am not a native speaker of English, please read with a bit of caution and tolerance. (However, I am not particularly good at Chinese either. So be careful too.)

The content about work does not claim to carry original ideas, though they are all my own thoughts and ideas. On the contrary, they may serve to record an important lesson I learned along the way, or fill in gaps that puzzled me when I read some books or articles. And since I collected these ideas here and there, I cannot cite the proper reference some time. So please forgive me for not giving due credit for the great thinkers to whom the original ideas belong.
